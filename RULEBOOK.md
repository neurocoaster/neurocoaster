# Action Potential Coaster - Rule Book
## BME 422 Educational Game

---

## Overview

**NeuroCoaster** is an educational roller coaster based game designed to teach the physiology of neuronal action potential and core nervous system concepts. Players advance through the stages of  action potential by correctly answering neuroscience questions. Your character evolves visually and functionally as the membrane potential changes. The goal is to successfully complete the full action potential cycle while earning the highest score.

---

## Learning Objectives:
By playing Neurocoaster players will be able to:
1. Identify and explain the stages of an action potential
2. Understand ion channels behaviors (Na+, K+)
3. Relate membrane potential changes to neuronal function
4. Reinforce nervous system anatomy and physiology concepts


## Game Modes

### Single Player Mode
Play solo to learn and practice neuroscience concepts at your own pace.

## How to Play

### Basic Gameplay

1. **Answer Questions**: You'll be presented with multiple-choice or text-input questions about neuroscience topics.

2. **Progress Along the Track**: Each correct answer moves your neuron forward along the action potential curve.

3. **Reach Threshold**: After answering a certain number of questions (configurable), you reach the "threshold" checkpoint.

4. **Complete the Action Potential**: Answer all required questions to complete the action potential and win!

### Question Types

- **Multiple Choice**: Click the correct answer button
- **Text Input**: Type your answer (e.g., "-70" or "-70 mV" for membrane potential)

## Game Mechanics

### Study Mode vs Challenge Mode

**Study Mode** (Default):
- Wrong answers show an explanation and you continue
- Learn from mistakes without penalty
- Best for learning and practice

**Challenge Mode**:
- Wrong answers reset you to the start (or threshold if you've reached it)
- More difficult, tests your knowledge
- Best for testing mastery

### Threshold Checkpoint System

The **threshold** represents the "all-or-nothing" principle of action potentials:

- **Before Threshold**: 
  - Wrong answers reset you to start (Challenge mode) or let you continue (Study mode)
  
- **After Threshold**:
  - Wrong answers = **stay in place** (no reset, no progress)
  - Once you cross threshold, you can't go backward
  - Reflects the irreversible nature of action potentials

### Myelin Power ⚡

- **Activation**: Get 3 correct answers in a row
- **Effect**: Activates "Saltatory Conduction" - your neuron moves faster with a jump effect
- **Visual**: Your neuron gains a speed boost along the track
- **Resets**: Lost on any wrong answer

---

## Settings

### Configurable Options

**Total Questions**: Set between 7-30 questions to complete the game
- Default: 25 questions

**Questions Until Threshold**: Set how many questions must be answered before reaching threshold
- Default: 7 questions
- Must be less than total questions

**Access Settings**: 
- Single Player: Click "Settings" button

---

### Excitatory Power-Up
- **Effect**: Speeds up opponents
- **Mechanic**: Decreases opponents' threshold requirement by 2 questions
- **Example**: If threshold is 7, opponents now need only 5 questions to reach threshold
- **Auto-Threshold**: If threshold becomes 0 or negative, opponents automatically reach threshold

### Inhibitory Power-Up
- **Effect**: Slows down opponents
- **Mechanic**: Increases opponents' threshold requirement by 2 questions
- **Example**: If threshold is 7, opponents now need 9 questions to reach threshold

### Power-Up Persistence
- **Saved**: Power-up effects are saved to your browser and persist across game restarts
- **Applied**: Effects apply to all opponents who haven't reached threshold yet
- **Cumulative**: Multiple power-ups stack (can be applied multiple times)

---

## Scoring System

### Points
- **Base Score**: 10 points per correct answer
- **Streak Bonus**: +1 point per consecutive correct answer (up to +10 bonus)
- **Maximum per Question**: 20 points (10 base + 10 streak bonus)

### Statistics Tracked
- **Score**: Total points earned
- **Streak**: Current consecutive correct answers
- **Fails**: Total incorrect answers
- **Progress**: Percentage and questions answered
- **Time**: Elapsed time (with best time tracking)

---

## Winning

### Single Player
- Complete all required questions
- View your completion time and best time

---

## Tips & Strategies

### For Learning
- Start in **Study Mode** to learn from mistakes
- Read explanations carefully when you get questions wrong
- Use the random question system to test knowledge across all topics

### For Competition
- Switch to **Challenge Mode** for a real test
- Build streaks to activate Myelin Power for faster progress

### Threshold Strategy
- Reaching threshold is a major milestone
- After threshold, wrong answers don't reset you
- Focus on accuracy after threshold since you can't go backward
